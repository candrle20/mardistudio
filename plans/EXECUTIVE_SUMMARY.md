# 🪶 Mardi Studio Pro — Executive Summary

**Date:** November 4, 2025  
**Confidential**

---

## The Opportunity

**Mardi Studio Pro** transforms the $1.5B wedding stationery market by combining artist-trained AI with professional print automation — delivering bespoke luxury invites at $500 instead of $3,000, in 10 days instead of 8 weeks.

---

## The Problem

### For Brides
- Custom wedding stationery costs **$1,500-$10,000** from professional studios
- Generic templates from Minted/Zola lack uniqueness (**60% of brides compromise**)
- DIY tools like Canva require **20+ hours** and still look amateur
- Print quality issues: RGB instead of CMYK, missing bleed, color mismatches

### For Artists
- Seasonal income (**Feb-Aug peak, Oct-Jan famine**)
- Underpricing due to unclear value (**burnout or lost clients**)
- One-time commissions: **no recurring revenue** from past work
- Existing licensing platforms (Minted) take **60-90% of revenue**

### For Wedding Planners
- Stationery is always the **bottleneck** (2-3 week lead times)
- Managing 15-30 clients simultaneously → **can't scale**
- Revisions add **5-7 days per round**
- Rush orders cost **50-100% premium**

---

## The Solution

**Mardi Studio Pro** is a vertical creative-AI platform that enables:

### 1. Brides & Couples
Generate complete wedding suites (invite, RSVP, menu, signage) in **< 2 hours** using artist-trained AI models. Edit in a pro web editor, receive print-ready PDF/X-1a files, order printed invites delivered in **7-10 days**.

**Price:** $500 design + $200-700 print = **$700-1,200 total** (vs $3K-10K traditional)

### 2. Wedding Planners
Manage multiple client projects in dedicated workspaces. Generate same-day proofs, white-label designs, invoice clients with markup. **10x faster** than traditional workflow.

**Price:** $99-499/month SaaS subscription

### 3. Artists
Upload portfolio (300-500 scans), platform trains custom AI model. Earn **40% royalties** every time a bride uses your style. Zero ongoing work after initial upload.

**Passive Income:** $2K-5K/month per artist (projected)

## Defensibility

### Moats
1. **Proprietary Artist Datasets:** 300-500 scans per artist, curated and trained → hard to replicate
2. **LoRA Model Registry:** Versioned, encrypted, per-artist isolation → IP protection
3. **Print-Grade Pipeline:** CMYK, ICC profiles, foil plates, 18+ preflight checks → technical expertise
4. **Vendor Network:** Multi-partner routing with QC feedback loop → improves over time
5. **Two-Sided Marketplace:** More artists → more styles → more brides → more revenue → more artists (flywheel)

### Barriers to Entry
- **AI Expertise:** Fine-tuning for print quality (not just web aesthetics)
- **Artist Relationships:** Trust, onboarding, royalty transparency
- **Print Partnerships:** Vetted vendors, API integrations, SLA management
- **Regulatory:** GDPR, PCI DSS (via Stripe), copyright/IP compliance

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### Top Risks

#### 1. AI Quality Not Good Enough
**Probability:** Medium | **Impact:** High  
**Mitigation:** Train on 500+ scans, human QA, A/B testing, "Artist Touch-Up" service ($100)

#### 2. Print Defects

**Mitigation:** Rigorous preflight (18+ checks), test orders, defect feedback loop, hard proofs ($50)

#### 3. Slow Artist Recruitment
**Probability:** High | **Impact:** Medium  
**Mitigation:** $500 advance, success stories (artist earning $3K/month), art school partnerships

#### 4. High CAC, Low LTV
**Probability:** Medium | **Impact:** High  
**Mitigation:** Optimize ads (10+ creatives), referral program (viral > 0.5), reorder incentives (10% off)

#### 5. GPU Costs Spiral
**Probability:** Medium | **Impact:** High  
**Mitigation:** Spot instances (50% savings), caching (10% duplicate requests), batching, distillation
