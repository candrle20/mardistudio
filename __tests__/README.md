# Tests Placeholder

A formal testing harness (Jest/Vitest) is not yet configured.

Planned coverage:

- `lib/gemini/client` — unit tests with mocked Gemini SDK responses.
- `app/api/generate` and `app/api/generate/edit` — API integration tests.
- `app/api/export/pdf` — print pipeline regression tests once implemented.

> TODO: Add testing framework and implement the above suites.
